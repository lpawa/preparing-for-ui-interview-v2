# Prepare for UI Interview V2

This is a **Frontend Masters - Prepare for UI Interview V2** supporting repo. Here you will find problems that we solve together on the course along with additional materials and reference solutions for DOM API Based / React based challenges.

## 🎓 Course Structure

The course is divided into multiple sections, and with each section, we will gradually increase the difficulty.

### Classic JavaScript Problems
This section serves as a warm-up. We will start with short (5–10 minute) problems that provide an overview of common JavaScript utilities and patterns frequently tested in interviews.

### Practical UI Problems
Here, we will get our hands dirty and implement real UI patterns, components, and parts of applications.
We will actively use **HTML**, **CSS**, **TypeScript**, and **React**.

Each problem will have:
- A vanilla (framework-free) solution
- A React-based solution

During the workshop, we will intentionally switch between vanilla JavaScript and React to strengthen both skill sets.

### TypeScript Problems
Finally, we will cover essential TypeScript type-level programming—the kind often asked in senior and staff-level frontend interviews.

## 🧠 Problem Difficulty

The problems in this workshop are intentionally slightly harder than real interview questions.
The idea is simple: **If you train on harder problems, real interviews will feel calmer and more manageable.**

Problems are grouped into the following difficulty levels:

### 🧘 Warm-up
- Very basic problems that you should solve quickly.
- **Expected time**: 2–4 minutes.

### 🟢 Easy
- Small 5–10 minute problems.
- Some companies may give 3–4 easy problems in a 45-minute screening interview.

### 🟡 Medium
- 15–20 minute problems.
- The majority of frontend interview questions fall into this category.

### 🔴 Hard
- 45+ minute problems that require practice and familiarity with specific browser APIs.
- During the workshop, we will aim to solve them in 20–25 minutes to save time, but in real interviews, you would typically spend 45–60 minutes.
- **Examples**:
    - Observer APIs
    - Drag & Drop
    - Event handling

### 🚀 Extreme
- 1–2 hour end-to-end problems.
- These usually involve building a minimal version of a real product feature from scratch.
- You may be provided with a mock server or API, and the focus shifts heavily toward architecture and structure.
- **Examples**:
    - Figma-like canvas
    - Google Sheets–style grid
    - To-do application
    - Chat application (e.g., ChatGPT-like UI)

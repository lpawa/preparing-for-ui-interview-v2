# Level 6: Recursive Types

**Concepts:** Self-referencing types, base cases, accumulators, depth limitation

> Advanced types often require recursion to process arbitrarily deep data structures like arrays, strings, or object trees.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Basic Recursion and Base Cases
A recursive type is one that references itself. Crucially, it needs a **Base Case** to stop infinite recursion, just like a recursive function needs an exit condition.

```typescript
type LinkedList<T> = T & { next: LinkedList<T> }; // Infinite definition (OK for interfaces/types)

// Conditional recursion naturally has a base case (the 'false' branch)
type RecursiveArray<T> = T extends (infer U)[] ? RecursiveArray<U> : T;
```

### 2. Recursive Conditional Types (Looping)
Recursion is the primary way to "loop" in the type system. You process one item (head), and recursively call the type with the rest (tail).

```typescript
type Reverse<T extends any[]> = 
  T extends [infer Head, ...infer Tail] 
    ? [...Reverse<Tail>, Head] 
    : []; // Base case: empty array
```

### 3. Deep Mutability
Recursion allows you to traverse deep object structures, modifying properties at every level (e.g., making everything `readonly`).

```typescript
type DeepReadonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: DeepReadonly<T[P]>;
};
```

### 4. Recursion Limits
TypeScript has a recursion depth limit (around 50-100 depending on complexity and version). Exceeding this results in "Type instantiation is excessively deep".
- **Tail Recursion Elimination**: Modern TS versions check for tail recursion to allow deeper limits.
- **Counter**: Sometimes you must manually track depth using an accumulator tuple to stop before the limit.

### 5. Accumulator Pattern
Since we can't do `x = x + 1`, we use an array's `length` as a counter. We pass an accumulator generic parameter to carry state between recursive calls.

```typescript
type Count<N, Acc extends any[] = []> = 
  Acc['length'] extends N 
    ? Acc 
    : Count<N, [...Acc, 1]>; // Add 1 to accumulator
```

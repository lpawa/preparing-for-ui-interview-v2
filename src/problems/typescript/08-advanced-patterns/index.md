## Key Concepts

### 1. Key Remapping with `as`
Introduced in TS 4.1, this allows you to transform keys in a mapped type using a clause `as NewKey`. If `NewKey` results in `never`, the key is filtered out.

```typescript
type Getters<T> = {
  [K in keyof T as `get${Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => T[K]
};

type Person = { name: string; age: number };
type PersonGetters = Getters<Person>;
// { getName: () => string; getAge: () => number; }
```

### 2. Filtering Keys (Omit by Type)
By combining Key Remapping with Conditional Types, you can filter keys based on their **values**.

```typescript
type RemoveStringFields<T> = {
  [K in keyof T as T[K] extends string ? never : K]: T[K]
};

// If T[K] is string, the key becomes 'never' (removed). 
// Otherwise, it stays as K.
```

### 3. Modifying Modifiers Selectively
You can apply modifiers like `?` or `readonly` only to specific keys.

```typescript
type RequiredKeys<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]-?: {} extends Pick<T, K> ? never : K
}[keyof T];
// Returns a union of keys that are required.
```

### 4. Advanced Array Transformations
Using recursive conditional types (from Level 6) on arrays allows for operations like `Chunk`, `Zip`, or `Join`.

```typescript
type Join<T extends string[], U extends string> = 
  T extends [infer F extends string, ...infer R extends string[]]
    ? R['length'] extends 0 ? F : `${F}${U}${Join<R, U>}`
    : "";
```

| # | Problem | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 8.1 | [PickByType](./01-pick-by-type.ts) | From `T`, pick a set of properties whose type are assignable to `U`. |
| 8.2 | [OmitByType](./02-omit-by-type.ts) | From `T`, pick a set of properties whose type are not assignable to `U`. |
| 8.3 | [PartialByKeys](./03-partial-by-keys.ts) | Make properties specified in `K` optional. |
| 8.4 | [Chunk](./04-chunk.ts) | Bundle elements of array `T` into subarrays of size `U`. |

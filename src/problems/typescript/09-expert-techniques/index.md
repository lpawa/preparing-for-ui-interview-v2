## Key Concepts

### 1. Union to Intersection (Contravariance)
TypeScript functions arguments are **contravariant** (they accept supertypes, but when comparing functions, it's inverted). We exploit this to flip a union `A | B` into an intersection `A & B`.

**Mechanism:**
1. Transform union `U` into a union of functions: `(arg: A) => void | (arg: B) => void`.
2. Use conditional types to infer the argument of a *single* function that matches that union.
3. Due to contravariance, TypeScript infers the intersection `A & B` for the argument.

```typescript
type UnionToIntersection<U> = 
  (U extends any ? (k: U) => void : never) extends ((k: infer I) => void) 
    ? I 
    : never
```

### 2. Detecting `any`
The `any` type is notorious for being both a supertype and a subtype of everything. It breaks normal conditional checks.
The hack relies on `any`'s ability to intersect with anything to produce `any`.

```typescript
// 1 & any  -> any
// 1 & string -> never (or just fails)

type IsAny<T> = 0 extends (1 & T) ? true : false;
```
If `T` is `any`, `1 & T` is `any`. Then `0 extends any` is true.
If `T` is `string`, `1 & T` is `never` (or distinct), so `0 extends ...` is false.

### 3. Tuples as Counters (Math)
Since TypeScript typings are Turing-complete, we can perform arithmetic. We usually use the length of a tuple to represent numbers.

```typescript
// Add two numbers A + B
type Add<A extends number, B extends number> = 
    [...BuildTuple<A>, ...BuildTuple<B>]['length'];
```

### 4. Matrix Operations
By combining array inference and recursion, we can manipulate 2D arrays (matrices). This often involves:
- Using `[number]` to access column types.
- Mapping over keys to transpose rows/cols.
- Recursive processing of rows.

# Level 7: Distributive Conditional Types

**Concepts:** Union distribution, preventing distribution, checking for unions

> A unique feature where conditional types distribute over union constituents.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Default Distribution (Naked Generics)
Distributivity is triggered when:
1. The type being checked is a **naked generic parameter** (e.g. `T`).
2. The checked type is a **Union**.

If both types are true, the condition applies to *each member* of the union individually.

```typescript
type ToArray<T> = T extends any ? T[] : never;
type StrArrOrNumArr = ToArray<string | number>;
// Becomes: ToArray<string> | ToArray<number>
// Result: string[] | number[]
```

### 2. Preventing Distribution
To stop this behavior (and treat the union as a single block), wrap the generic in a tuple `[]` on both sides of the `extends`.

```typescript
type ToArray<T> = [T] extends [any] ? T[] : never;
type StrOrNumArr = ToArray<string | number>;
// Becomes: (string | number)[]
```

### 3. Checking for Unions
We can exploit distributivity to check if a type is a union. The trick is:
1. Let `T` distribute.
2. Inside the true branch, compare the distributed `T` (which is now a single member) against the original `T` (which is still the full union).
3. If they are different, it was a union (because a member is not equal to the whole group).

```typescript
type IsUnion<T, U = T> = U extends any 
    ? ([T] extends [U] ? false : true)
    : never;
```
